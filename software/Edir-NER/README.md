# Edir-NER

Neural model tools for NER and label prediction of brain radiology reports

ftp transfer.  We use pyenv for each variant of model we have as some are pytorch some are tensorflow. 
However, it may be easier just to create conda environments for each tool if that is preferred?  
In addition we download required models such as spacy, huggingface

# Dependencies

Tensorflow 2.5.  We use tensorflow 2.11 but as I mentioned in email this does need access to a v2.10 library file.  I think we would need to test this on new hardware though.
