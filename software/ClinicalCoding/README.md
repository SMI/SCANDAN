# ClinicalCoding

Explainable Automated Clinical Coding as Deep Learning Multi-label Classification Problem

We use conda or pip to install. Also we need ftp transfer to edit the configurations
and transfer model files from OneDrive.

# Dependencies

For HLAN: Tensorflow 1.15.5 (or other versions 1.x), cuda-10.0.130, cuDNN-7.4.1.5_10.0. For CAML: Pytorch 0.3.0, cuda-9.0, cudnn-7.6.5.

These won't work as our A100 has CUDA 11.
